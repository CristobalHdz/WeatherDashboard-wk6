# Section 02: General Information
This week's assignment is to make a weather application with the usage of the `https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api` API. Having to use local storage to store the most recent cities searched. Also, when we call the API we should see the weather for the next 5 days.

# Section 03: My experience
Beggining the project was easy. I just started using materialize and everything was getting into place.

With the JS I started by appliying the local storage for the search of the 5 cities. Had to go back to my other projects to see if there could be an answer, which I found on project #4. When the local storages were saved, I started working on them being replaced if the user typed something new. `The cities will get replaced only if they are the first 5 cities we search when the page is loaded.` After that they will not be replacing the storage.
